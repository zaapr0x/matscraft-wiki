## About Blocks

Matscraft features five distinct types of ore blocks that players can find and mine throughout the world. These blocks are a primary source of **$MATS**.

The five ore block types, ordered by increasing rarity, are:

- Common Mats Ore
- Uncommon Mats Ore
- Rare Mats Ore
- Epic Mats Ore
- Legendary Mats Ore

Each block drops a different amount of **$MATS**, depending on its rarity.

<Note type="info">
  To get the $MATS drops, you’ll need a **special pickaxe** for each type of
  block. [Learn more about pickaxes](pickaxe-ability/)
