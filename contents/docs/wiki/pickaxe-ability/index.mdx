## About Pickaxes

In Matscraft, mining different tiers of ore requires specific pickaxes. Using the correct pickaxe is essential to break the ore block and collect the $MATS it contains.

Generally, higher-tier pickaxes can mine ore blocks of their corresponding maximum rarity and all lower rarity tiers. Pickaxes are available for purchase using $MATS.

Refer to the [Matscraft Blocks](block/) documentation for details on ore types and their yields.
